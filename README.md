QGEP-customizer allows customization of main [QGEP](https://github.com/QGEP) project.
It handles the following changes in the project:
- coordinate reference system
- translation (fields, forms, layers, legend, etc.)
- custom symbology
- additional background layers


Use `customizer.sh config.yaml` to customize the QGEP project.

See the template (congig.yaml.template) for an example.
